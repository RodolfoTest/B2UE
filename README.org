#+TITLE: Blender to UE Asset Importer
#+AUTHOR: Rodolfo Barcelli Jo

* Introduction
This project is designed to import a whole scene into Unreal from Blender while avoiding the limitation of the whole scene being one FBX Mesh.

* Usage
** Blender
*WARNING:* The script will export all the unique meshes in your scene and a location_data.csv to the same folder that your blend file is saved in. Therefore, please make sure that you have saved your blend file before running the script.

Select all the objects in the scene that you want to export. Press Alt+p and select "Clear and Keep Transform". This is a necessary step for the exporting process

Open a text editor window in blender and load the exporter.py script

Select all items that you want to export and press the play button next to the script name. You should experience a freeze and blender will export all the unique meshes as well as create a location_data.csv file.

** Unreal
Create a folder called "Python" in your Content folder and place the importer.py script there. (If you have the engine open you will have to restart it)

Make a folder for your static meshes and place the location_data.csv file in that folder

Start the engine and import all the exported FBX files to this folder. Make sure that Uniform Scale is set to 1 in the FBX Importer and if you want materials that Create New Material is set

In the command prompt, input the following command ~importer.py /Path/To/Your/Folder~
*NOTE: Remember to replace the path wit the path of the static meshes as shown below*

After the script is run your scene should be loaded in a level called import. You can copy this over to another level or add the level as a sublevel to an existing level

** [ ] Python Socket Server (Blender Side)
** [ ] Python Socket Client (Unreal Side)
** [ ] Database Integration and Diff Management
